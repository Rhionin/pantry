# Pantry Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying Pantry on a Raspberry Pi using Docker Compose.

## Quick Start

New to this? Follow these steps in order on your Raspberry Pi and you'll have Pantry running. The setup script does the heavy lifting; each step says what it does. For options, backups, and troubleshooting, use the reference sections further down.

1. **What you need.** A Raspberry Pi running 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS, and the ability to open a terminal. (See [Supported Platform](#supported-platform) below for exact hardware and OS details.)

2. **Get the Pantry files onto the Pi.** The deployment files live in this repository's `deploy/` folder: `docker-compose.yml`, `Caddyfile`, `.env.example`, `setup.sh`, and the `systemd/` and `udev/` folders. Copy that whole folder onto your Pi (for example, clone the repo with `git`, or copy with a USB drive or `scp`).

3. **Run the setup script.** From the `deploy/` folder you copied over:

   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh
   ```

   This installs Docker if needed, copies the deployment files into `/opt/pantry`, creates your configuration, installs the scanner udev rule, starts Pantry, and waits until it reports healthy. It is safe to re-run: it never overwrites configuration values you already set. When `PUBLIC_HOST` is already set and `/opt/pantry/auth.caddy` exists, it also keeps the public HTTPS proxy on the current compose file and Caddyfile, and it applies the LAN firewall on the published Pantry port. `install`, `publish`, and `firewall` are the same command.

4. **Check it works.** The installer already polled `/health` for you, but you can confirm any time. This should print `{"status":"ok"}`:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

   You can also open `http://<pi-ip-address>:8080` in a web browser on any device on the same network. After setup, `sudo ./setup.sh status` prints that address. When Avahi is installed it also publishes `http://pantry.local:8080`. If `https://pantry.rhionin.com` hangs on home Wi-Fi and loads on cellular, the router is not hairpinning; use the LAN address. See [Home Wi-Fi hangs on the public name](#home-wi-fi-hangs-on-the-public-name).

5. **See the full picture.** Run the diagnostic any time to see the whole chain from udev rule to scan ingestion:

   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh status
   ```

6. **Optional: open it to the public internet.** The steps above stay on your home network. To serve the same UI at a hostname you own, such as `https://pantry.rhionin.com`, follow [Public Internet access](#public-internet-access). The Gryphon router does not hairpin, so that name hangs on home Wi-Fi when it is reached through a port forward. [Cloudflare Tunnel](#cloudflare-tunnel) is the path that works on home Wi-Fi and on cellular without forwarding ports. The public site asks for one shared password. The timing snapshot at `/api/telemetry` is public on that hostname.

## Updating

After `git pull` on the Pi, from `deploy/`:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

That one command is the whole update. It copies `deploy/` to `/opt/pantry`, starts the containers from the compose file you just pulled (including the public HTTPS proxy when `PUBLIC_HOST` is set and `/opt/pantry/auth.caddy` is already there), restarts Caddy so the current `Caddyfile` is what is serving, applies the LAN firewall for the published Pantry port, and republishes `pantry.local` when Avahi is installed. When `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` is set, the same command keeps the tunnel profile instead of ports 80 and 443. That Caddyfile leaves `GET /api/telemetry`, `POST /api/telemetry/client`, `GET /brand/logo.png`, `GET /terms`, and `GET /privacy` public. Run it again any time. Existing `.env` values stay, an existing `auth.caddy` is not regenerated, and a site that is already on the public internet stays there. LAN `http://<pi-ip>:8080` stays up. On the certificate path, the public name still hangs on home Wi-Fi until the router hairpins or you use the LAN address; see [Home Wi-Fi hangs on the public name](#home-wi-fi-hangs-on-the-public-name). Tunnel mode does not have that hang.

`sudo ./setup.sh firewall-off` removes the port rule until the next setup. To leave it off, set `PANTRY_LAN_FIREWALL=off` in `/opt/pantry/.env` and run `sudo ./setup.sh` again.

**The scanner is optional at every step.** Pantry starts and serves the web UI whether or not a barcode scanner is attached, and you can connect or disconnect the scanner at any time — see [Headless Scanner Input](#headless-scanner-input).

The rest of this guide is reference material: configuration options, backups, the barcode scanner, rolling back, and troubleshooting.

## Supported Platform

**Target:** 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS on arm64 hardware

Pantry is packaged as a `linux/arm64` container image and requires 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS running on compatible hardware (Raspberry Pi 3B+, 4, 5, or newer models with arm64 architecture).

## First-Time Setup

The recommended path is `sudo ./setup.sh`, which performs every step below in order and verifies the result. The steps are documented here so you understand what the script does and can run them by hand if you prefer.

### 1. Install Docker and Docker Compose

Install Docker and the Compose plugin on your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker (this is what setup.sh runs)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh

# Add your user to the docker group (requires logout/login to take effect)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Verify installation
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Log out and back in for the group membership to take effect.

### 2. Set up deployment files and configuration

`sudo ./setup.sh` copies the whole `deploy/` tree to `/opt/pantry` (including `systemd/` and `udev/`) and reconciles `.env`. To do it by hand:

```bash
# Create deployment directory
sudo mkdir -p /opt/pantry

# Copy the entire deploy/ directory contents to /opt/pantry
# (docker-compose.yml, Caddyfile, .env.example, setup.sh, systemd/, udev/)

# Create your config from the example; the defaults work to get started
cd /opt/pantry
sudo cp .env.example .env
sudo nano .env  # edit if needed — see the Configuration table below
```

The script's `.env` handling is idempotent: it creates `.env` from `.env.example` only when it is absent, and on later runs appends only keys that are missing, never touching a value you already set. A pinned `PANTRY_IMAGE_TAG` therefore survives re-running `install`.

### 3. Install the scanner udev rule

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh rule
```

This detects your scanner and writes `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-pantry-scanner.rules` with a symlink at `/dev/input/pantry-scanner`. See [Headless Scanner Input](#headless-scanner-input) for how to do it manually or for a Bluetooth scanner. This step is optional — Pantry runs without it — but scanning won't work until a matching rule exists.

### 4. Start Pantry

```bash
cd /opt/pantry
sudo docker compose up -d
```

The container starts whether or not the scanner is attached. There is **no ordering requirement**: you can install the udev rule and attach the scanner before or after starting the container, in any order.

### 5. Verify deployment

```bash
# Health check — should return {"status":"ok"}
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Full chain diagnostic
sudo ./setup.sh status

# Access the web UI at http://<pi-ip-address>:8080 from any device on your network
```

## Public Internet access

This puts the Pantry UI on a hostname you already own, with HTTPS, using the same Docker Compose stack. The recommended name is a subdomain (`pantry.rhionin.com`) so the bare domain can stay unused.

The Gryphon in this house does not hairpin, so `https://pantry.rhionin.com` hangs on home Wi-Fi when DNS points at the router's WAN address. [Cloudflare Tunnel](#cloudflare-tunnel) is how that URL works on home Wi-Fi and on cellular without forwarding ports 80 and 443. The steps in this section are the certificate and port-forward path. Leave those forwards in place until the tunnel has been tested on both networks.

The public site asks for one shared password before it serves the UI, the API, and the live scan stream. That stops scanners and other bots that do not have the password. It is not separate accounts, and anyone who has the password can change the pantry. These exact paths stay open without that password: `GET /api/telemetry`, `POST /api/telemetry/client`, `GET /brand/logo.png`, `GET /terms`, and `GET /privacy`. The snapshot is counters and durations only — no barcodes, product names, or user ids — so an agent can `curl` it. The brand mark and the two legal pages are public because a grocery login stores those URLs. The home-network address `http://<pi-ip>:8080` does not ask for the password, so do not forward port 8080 on the router.

The path below is Caddy in the `public` Compose profile, a Let's Encrypt certificate, and an A record at Squarespace. It needs a public IPv4 address and the ability to forward TCP ports 80 and 443. If your ISP uses CGNAT, skip to [When port forwarding cannot work](#when-port-forwarding-cannot-work).

### 1. Confirm the Pi is reachable from the internet

On the Pi:

```bash
curl -4 https://ifconfig.me
```

That prints the address the internet sees. On your router, open the WAN / internet status page and read the WAN IP.

- If those two addresses match, and the WAN address is not in `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, or `100.64.0.0/10`, port forwarding can work.
- If they differ, or the router WAN address is in one of those ranges, the ISP is using CGNAT. Forwarding ports will not make the Pi reachable. Use [Cloudflare Tunnel](#when-port-forwarding-cannot-work) instead.

Reserve a DHCP lease for the Pi (or set a static LAN address) so the forward does not follow the Pi to a new address later.

### 2. Forward ports on the router

Create two forwards to the Pi's LAN address:

| WAN (external) | Pi (internal) |
|----------------|---------------|
| TCP 80 | TCP 80 |
| TCP 443 | TCP 443 |

UDP 443 is optional. It enables HTTP/3. The site works with only the two TCP forwards.

Do not forward port 8080. Leave UPnP off, and delete any other forward you are not using.

The published Pantry port is IPv4-only (`0.0.0.0`). That keeps a global IPv6 address on the Pi from answering on 8080. It does not stop a router forward: a forwarded packet is still addressed to the Pi's LAN IPv4 address, and Docker's userland proxy accepts it. `ufw` does not close that port either. Docker accepts the connection in its own proxy and, separately, DNATs it around the `INPUT` chain `ufw` edits.

If `sudo ufw status` says `active`, allow the proxy ports. Leave a firewall that is currently inactive turned off. Enabling it without an SSH allow rule can lock you out of the Pi.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/udp
```

`sudo ./setup.sh` also drops non-LAN clients that reach the Pantry port (loopback, private LAN, and Tailscale `100.64.0.0/10` stay allowed; ports 80 and 443 are not changed). That runs whenever compose publishes the port, which the stock file always does, and whenever the public proxy is on. Set `PANTRY_LAN_FIREWALL=off` in `/opt/pantry/.env` and run `sudo ./setup.sh` again to leave the port reachable from any source. `sudo ./setup.sh firewall-off` removes the rule only until the next setup. Do not forward port 8080 either way. The router rule above is the one that matters for the public site.

### 3. Point the Squarespace domain at that address

`rhionin.com` stays registered at Squarespace. You are adding one DNS record, not moving the domain.

1. Open the [Squarespace domains dashboard](https://account.squarespace.com/domains) and sign in.
2. Click **rhionin.com**.
3. Click **DNS**, then **DNS Settings**.
4. Under **Custom records**, click **Add record**.
5. Set:
   - **Type:** A
   - **Host:** `pantry`  
     Squarespace appends `.rhionin.com`. Do not type the full name, and do not type `https://`.
   - **Data** (IP address): the IPv4 from `curl -4 https://ifconfig.me`
6. Save the record.

Leave the Squarespace default records for `@` and `www` alone. A new host named `pantry` does not conflict with them. Use host `@` only if you want `https://rhionin.com` itself; in that case delete the Squarespace default A and CNAME records for `@` first, because a custom record cannot override those presets.

Squarespace does not offer a TTL field; their DNS is commonly cached for about four hours. Check that the record has landed before asking for a certificate:

```bash
dig +short pantry.rhionin.com A
```

The answer must be the same address `curl -4 https://ifconfig.me` prints. If `dig` is not installed, `getent hosts pantry.rhionin.com` is enough. This often updates within an hour and can take up to a day.

When your home IP changes, edit this same A record. The certificate is for the hostname, so HTTPS starts working again as soon as DNS matches the new address. Squarespace has no dynamic-DNS service; updating the record is a manual step.

### 4. Start the proxy

On the Pi, edit `/opt/pantry/.env` (create the LAN install first with `sudo ./setup.sh` if you have not):

```bash
PUBLIC_HOST=pantry.rhionin.com
ACME_EMAIL=you@example.com
BASIC_AUTH_USER=pantry
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-long-passphrase
```

`PUBLIC_HOST` is the hostname only. `ACME_EMAIL` is where Let's Encrypt sends expiry notices. Replace `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` with a passphrase of 12 to 72 characters, and do not wrap it in quotes. The first `sudo ./setup.sh` after that hashes it into `/opt/pantry/auth.caddy` (mode `0600`) and restricts `.env` to its owner. The password itself stays in `.env`. It is not written into the image or the repository. A later run keeps the existing `auth.caddy` and does not ask for the password again.

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

That refreshes `docker-compose.yml` and `Caddyfile` into `/opt/pantry`, starts Pantry, and starts [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) on ports 80 and 443. Caddy requests a Let's Encrypt certificate for `PUBLIC_HOST` and renews it on its own. Starting the proxy accepts the Let's Encrypt subscriber agreement. The same command restarts Caddy after a later pull so a new `Caddyfile` is what is serving.

Certificates are stored in the Docker volume `caddy-data`. Do not delete that volume to "retry" a failure: Let's Encrypt rate-limits repeat issuances (on the order of five duplicate certificates per hostname per week).

### 5. Prove it is public

From a phone on cellular data, not the home Wi-Fi:

```bash
curl -fsS -u 'pantry:replace-with-a-long-passphrase' https://pantry.rhionin.com/health
```

Without the password, that command returns `401`. With it, expect `{"status":"ok",...}`. Then open `https://pantry.rhionin.com` in the phone's browser, enter the same username and password when asked, and confirm the pantry UI loads. The scan queue and inventory pages keep a live connection to `/api/events`; new scans should show up without a refresh.

The timing snapshot does not use the password. From the same phone:

```bash
curl -fsS https://pantry.rhionin.com/api/telemetry
```

Expect JSON with a `pageLoad` object. A `401` on `/health` without a password is still correct. Caddy also serves these exact paths without the password:

```bash
curl -fsS -D - -o /dev/null https://pantry.rhionin.com/brand/logo.png
curl -fsS -D - -o /dev/null https://pantry.rhionin.com/terms
curl -fsS -D - -o /dev/null https://pantry.rhionin.com/privacy
```

Expect `200` with `image/png` for the mark and `text/html` for the two pages. `/favicon.ico`, `/health`, and every other path still require the password. The `sudo ./setup.sh` above is what puts that Caddyfile in front of the site. An image update does not reload it.

To change the password, edit `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`, remove `/opt/pantry/auth.caddy`, and run `sudo ./setup.sh` again. Leaving `auth.caddy` in place keeps the current hash, so a routine setup does not regenerate it or ask you to type the password again. Browsers that saved the old password will ask again after the hash changes.

`sudo ./setup.sh unpublish` stops only the proxy. The LAN site keeps running. Clear `PUBLIC_HOST` as well if an automatic-update timer is enabled, or the next `sudo ./setup.sh` will start the proxy again.

### Home Wi-Fi hangs on the public name

On the certificate path, `https://pantry.rhionin.com` loads on cellular and sits there on home Wi-Fi until the browser gives up. Caddy and Pantry are up the whole time. [Cloudflare Tunnel](#cloudflare-tunnel) is how the same name loads on both. The rest of this section is the port-forward behavior. The phone on Wi-Fi looks up the public DNS A record, gets the router's WAN address (`38.148.49.79` in this house), and sends the connection to the Gryphon. Cellular never does that: it is already outside the house, so the same port forward delivers it to the Pi.

That inside-the-house path is NAT hairpin (also called NAT loopback or NAT reflection). The router has to send a connection aimed at its own WAN address back to `192.168.1.203`. Many home routers drop or ignore that connection instead of refusing it, so the browser hangs rather than showing an error. Nothing on the Pi can answer a packet that never arrives. This repository does not change the Gryphon.

**Use this on home Wi-Fi.** It does not go through the router, and it does not ask for the shared password:

| From a phone on this Wi-Fi | What it is |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| `http://192.168.1.203:8080` | Pantry on the Pi's LAN address. `sudo ./setup.sh status` prints the address it detected. |
| `http://pantry.local:8080` | The same port, published with mDNS when Avahi is installed. |

`192.168.1.203` is this Pi's reserved LAN address. If `status` prints a different address, use that one. If it prints a Docker bridge (often `172.17.0.1`), set `PANTRY_LAN_IPV4` to the Pi's real LAN address in `/opt/pantry/.env` and run `sudo ./setup.sh` again. Do not forward port 8080. That listener has no password.

Raspberry Pi OS usually already runs Avahi (`raspberrypi.local`). `sudo ./setup.sh` adds `pantry.local` and an HTTP service advertisement when `avahi-publish-address` is on the Pi. If status never mentions a published name:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y avahi-daemon
sudo ./setup.sh
```

Phones and computers that resolve `.local` (current iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows) can then open `http://pantry.local:8080` without knowing the IP. A DHCP reservation for the Pi still matters: mDNS follows the address setup detected, and a later address change is picked up the next time `pantry-mdns.service` starts (`sudo ./setup.sh` restarts it).

**Gryphon, if you want the public name itself to work on Wi-Fi.** Gryphon Connect is the only admin. Gryphon does not ship a browser admin page. This deploy does not turn anything on in that app.

1. In the Gryphon Connect app, confirm the Pi's DHCP reservation is still `192.168.1.203` (or whatever `PANTRY_LAN_IPV4` is).
2. Confirm the existing forwards, which are what make cellular work: external TCP 80 to the Pi's TCP 80, and external TCP 443 to the Pi's TCP 443. Leave UDP 443 optional. Do not add 8080.
3. Look through the app's network and advanced screens for NAT loopback, NAT reflection, or hairpin NAT. Gryphon's public help does not document that switch. If it is there, enable it for those two forwards and try `https://pantry.rhionin.com` on Wi-Fi again.
4. If the switch is not there, ask Gryphon support from the in-app chat to enable NAT loopback for the existing 80 and 443 forwards. Until they do, home Wi-Fi keeps using the LAN address above. The public name, the Let's Encrypt certificate, and the shared password stay as they are for everyone off the LAN.

**Same hostname on the LAN, without hairpin.** Caddy is already listening on the Pi's port 443. If a client resolves `pantry.rhionin.com` to the Pi's LAN address, it gets the real certificate and the same shared password. Internet DNS is left pointing at the WAN address, so cellular and other outside clients are unchanged.

That resolution is split-horizon DNS. It only helps devices that query the Pi. Gryphon often answers DNS itself for filtering, and the Connect app does not document a house-wide DNS server field. If a device cannot be pointed at the Pi, skip this and use the LAN URL.

To turn the answerer on:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y dnsmasq
```

In `/opt/pantry/.env`:

```bash
PANTRY_LAN_IPV4=192.168.1.203
PANTRY_SPLIT_DNS=on
```

Then `sudo ./setup.sh`. It writes a dnsmasq config that answers only this hostname with the LAN address, forwards every other name to 1.1.1.1 and 9.9.9.9, and listens on the LAN address rather than on every interface. It does not offer DHCP. Do not forward port 53 on the Gryphon. Devices that use the Pi for DNS skip Gryphon's filter for those other lookups. Leave `PANTRY_SPLIT_DNS` off when that filter should keep covering the house, and use the LAN address instead.

Check from a computer that is using the Pi as its DNS server:

```bash
dig +short pantry.rhionin.com A @192.168.1.203
```

The answer has to be `192.168.1.203`. If a phone on Wi-Fi still resolves the name to the WAN address, the phone is not using the Pi, and `https://pantry.rhionin.com` will keep hanging. Set `PANTRY_SPLIT_DNS=off` and run `sudo ./setup.sh` to remove the config.

A computer can also pin the name without dnsmasq, by adding a line to its hosts file (`192.168.1.203 pantry.rhionin.com`). Phones generally cannot edit a hosts file. Use the LAN URL on those.

### When something fails

Logs from the proxy:

```bash
cd /opt/pantry
sudo docker compose --profile public logs --tail=80 caddy
```

| What you see | What to fix |
|--------------|-------------|
| `NXDOMAIN`, or `dig` returns no address | The Squarespace A record is missing or still cached. Wait, then check `dig +short pantry.rhionin.com A` again. |
| Certificate error mentioning timeout, connection refused, or `404` from another site | Port 80 is not reaching this Pi. Re-check the router forward and that no other program is bound to port 80. |
| Browser warning, certificate name mismatch | `PUBLIC_HOST` and the Squarespace host are not the same name. They must match exactly. |
| `https://` works at home but not on cellular | The phone is still using the LAN address, or the forward is wrong. Test on cellular. |
| `https://` hangs on home Wi-Fi and loads on cellular | The router is not hairpinning. Pantry is reachable at `http://<pi-ip>:8080` and, when Avahi is installed, `http://pantry.local:8080`. See [Home Wi-Fi hangs on the public name](#home-wi-fi-hangs-on-the-public-name). |
| Browser or curl gets `401` | The shared password is missing or does not match `.env`. A request with no password is supposed to be rejected, except `GET /api/telemetry`, `POST /api/telemetry/client`, `GET /brand/logo.png`, `GET /terms`, and `GET /privacy`, which are public. Edit `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`, remove `/opt/pantry/auth.caddy`, and run `sudo ./setup.sh`. |
| UI loads, but the scan queue never updates live | `/api/events` is being buffered. `deploy/Caddyfile` must keep `flush_interval -1` on that path. Run `sudo ./setup.sh` after pulling a fresh `Caddyfile`. |

### Cloudflare Tunnel

This is the way `https://pantry.rhionin.com` works on home Wi-Fi and on cellular when the Gryphon does not hairpin, without forwarding ports 80 or 443. The Pi opens an outbound connection to Cloudflare. Caddy still asks for the same household password, and the same paths stay public: `GET /api/telemetry`, `POST /api/telemetry/client`, `GET /brand/logo.png`, `GET /terms`, and `GET /privacy`. Do not point the tunnel at port 8080. That port has no password. Do not turn on Cloudflare Access for this hostname. Caddy already asks for the password, and Access would be a second login.

LAN `http://192.168.1.203:8080` and `http://pantry.local:8080` keep working the whole time, with no password. Use them if the public name is down during the cutover.

The token is a secret. It lives only in `/opt/pantry/.env`. Do not commit it, and do not wrap it in quotes.

#### 1. Create a Cloudflare account and add the domain

1. Create a Cloudflare account on the **Free** plan.
2. Add the site `rhionin.com`. Cloudflare imports the DNS records it can see at Squarespace.
3. Stay on the Free plan. Tunnels are included. You do not need Zero Trust paid seats for this.

Do not change nameservers until the next step checks the import.

#### 2. Check the imported records, and turn DNSSEC off

Before the domain uses Cloudflare's nameservers, compare the imported records with Squarespace. A missing mail or website record is a silent outage after the switch.

In Squarespace: **Domains → rhionin.com → DNS → DNS Settings**. Write down:

- The website records: A and CNAME for `@` and `www`, and the existing `pantry` A record if it is there
- Every MX record
- Every TXT record (SPF, domain verification, and anything else)

In Cloudflare's DNS tab, confirm each of those is present and the values match. Fix Cloudflare's copy before continuing. Leave the `pantry` A record pointing at the home address for now. That keeps the current site up after the nameserver change, until you attach the tunnel hostname.

Turn **DNSSEC off at Squarespace** before changing nameservers. Squarespace: **Domains → rhionin.com → DNS → DNSSEC**. If DNSSEC stays on, resolvers will reject Cloudflare's answers.

#### 3. Change nameservers at Squarespace

Cloudflare shows two nameservers when you add the site. Copy them.

1. Open the [Squarespace domains dashboard](https://account.squarespace.com/domains).
2. Click **rhionin.com**.
3. Open **DNS**, then **Nameservers**.
4. Choose **use custom nameservers** and paste Cloudflare's two nameservers.

Registration stays at Squarespace. DNS moves to Cloudflare. Wait until Cloudflare says the site is active. Check from the Pi:

```bash
dig +short NS rhionin.com
```

The answers should be Cloudflare's nameservers. The existing `pantry` A record, now served by Cloudflare, still points at the home address, so cellular keeps working through the Gryphon forwards. Home Wi-Fi still hangs on that name. That is expected until the tunnel hostname replaces the A record.

#### 4. Create the tunnel and copy its token

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, open **Zero Trust**.
2. Go to **Networks → Tunnels**.
3. Create a tunnel. Give it a name you will recognize, such as `pantry`.
4. Choose the Docker install path. Copy the token. Cloudflare shows it once in the install command, after `--token`.

You will put that token in `/opt/pantry/.env` as `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN`. Do not run setup yet, and do not add the public hostname yet. The site is still on the A record.

#### 5. Add the public hostname

In the tunnel you just created, add a public hostname:

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| Subdomain | `pantry` |
| Domain | `rhionin.com` |
| Path | leave empty |
| Type | HTTP |
| URL | `http://caddy:80` |

`http://caddy:80` is the Caddy container on the Pi's Docker network. It is not a LAN address, and it is not port 8080. Cloudflare reaches it through the tunnel. The public side is HTTPS with Cloudflare's certificate. Caddy sees the original `https` scheme and the visitor address only because that connection comes from cloudflared.

Saving this hostname replaces the `pantry` A record with the tunnel. The public name stops working until the Pi is running cloudflared. Have the next command ready, then save the hostname.

#### 6. Put the token on the Pi and switch

On the Pi, edit `/opt/pantry/.env`:

```bash
PUBLIC_HOST=pantry.rhionin.com
PUBLISH_MODE=tunnel
CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=paste-the-token-here
BASIC_AUTH_USER=pantry
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-long-passphrase
```

`ACME_EMAIL` can stay. Tunnel mode does not request a certificate. Keep `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` as it already is if `/opt/pantry/auth.caddy` exists. Setup will not regenerate that file.

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh publish --tunnel
```

That is the command that switches modes. A later `sudo ./setup.sh` stays on the tunnel as long as the token is set, which is also what the automatic-update timer does. The command copies the tunnel compose file, starts `cloudflared` with `tunnel run`, and starts Caddy on an internal HTTP port only. Nothing on the Pi listens on 80 or 443. The shared password and the public paths are unchanged.

If `PANTRY_SPLIT_DNS` was on, this run removes it. A LAN answer for `pantry.rhionin.com` would send phones to the Pi, and Caddy is no longer on port 443 there. Leave `PANTRY_SPLIT_DNS=off`.

#### 7. Test on home Wi-Fi and on cellular

From a phone on home Wi-Fi, open `https://pantry.rhionin.com`, enter the household password, and confirm the pantry loads. Repeat on cellular data, with Wi-Fi off. Both should load. Neither should hang.

```bash
curl -fsS -u 'pantry:replace-with-a-long-passphrase' https://pantry.rhionin.com/health
curl -fsS https://pantry.rhionin.com/api/telemetry
```

`/health` without the password is `401`. `/api/telemetry` without the password is JSON. The brand mark, terms, and privacy URLs are still public. The Kroger callback stays behind the household password, same as before: the browser already has that password for this host when Kroger sends it back.

`http://192.168.1.203:8080` still does not ask for the password. Do not forward it.

#### 8. Remove the Gryphon forwards

Do this only after both networks load the public name. In Gryphon Connect, delete the forwards for external TCP 80 and external TCP 443 to `192.168.1.203`. Delete UDP 443 too if it was added. Do not add a forward for 8080.

If you previously ran `sudo ufw allow 80/tcp` and `sudo ufw allow 443/tcp`, you can delete those allows. Leave a firewall that is currently inactive turned off.

#### Rollback

Smaller rollback, DNS stays at Cloudflare:

1. Put the Gryphon TCP 80 and TCP 443 forwards back, to the Pi, before changing DNS.
2. In the tunnel, delete the public hostname `pantry.rhionin.com`.
3. In Cloudflare DNS, add an A record: name `pantry`, value the address from `curl -4 https://ifconfig.me` on the Pi.
4. On the Pi, empty `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` in `/opt/pantry/.env`. Leave `PUBLIC_HOST=pantry.rhionin.com`. Set `PUBLISH_MODE=acme` or leave it empty. A non-empty token keeps tunnel mode, so the token line has to be empty. Set `ACME_EMAIL` if it is empty.
5. Run `sudo ./setup.sh`. That stops cloudflared and starts Caddy on ports 80 and 443 again. The certificate volume from the earlier certificate path is still there.
6. Test on cellular. Home Wi-Fi hangs on the public name again. Use `http://192.168.1.203:8080` or `http://pantry.local:8080` on that network.

Full return to Squarespace DNS, after the smaller rollback is working:

1. Turn DNSSEC off at Cloudflare.
2. In Squarespace, set the nameservers back to Squarespace.
3. Recreate the website A and CNAME records, the MX records, the TXT records, and the `pantry` A record so they match what you wrote down.
4. Wait until `dig +short NS rhionin.com` shows Squarespace again, then test cellular one more time.

`sudo ./setup.sh unpublish` stops the proxy and cloudflared and leaves the LAN site up. Clear `PUBLIC_HOST` and `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` as well when the update timer is enabled, or the next update starts the tunnel again.

### When port forwarding cannot work

**Cloudflare Tunnel** is wired in. Use [Cloudflare Tunnel](#cloudflare-tunnel) when the Gryphon does not hairpin or when you cannot forward ports. Do not also run the certificate path in front of the same hostname.

**Tailscale Funnel** (fits a stable URL when you do not need `rhionin.com`) is not wired into this repo. The free personal tier can expose the Pi as a `*.ts.net` name without opening ports. Putting a Squarespace name on Funnel is more work than the Caddy path; use Funnel when a Tailscale hostname is enough. Do not funnel port 8080; that port has no password. Funnel the Caddy port, or put Tailscale in front of the LAN address and skip Funnel.

### What stays exposed if you forward ports

Forwarding 80 and 443 to a computer in the house is a different risk from a VPN or a tunnel. The Pi is on your LAN. Anyone who gets past the shared password is on a process that can read the pantry database, change inventory, and, if you connected Kroger, use the refresh token stored in that database. A bug or a guessed password is not confined to a cloud VM. A tunnel or Tailscale does not put a listening port on the home router; the router path does.

The shared password is one secret for the whole household. Caddy applies it to every path on the public hostname except `GET /api/telemetry`, `POST /api/telemetry/client`, `GET /brand/logo.png`, `GET /terms`, and `GET /privacy`. The telemetry paths are public so the timing snapshot can be read without credentials. The snapshot has no barcodes, product names, or user ids. The brand mark and the legal pages are public because a grocery developer app fetches those exact URLs. Inventory, scans, shopping, other static files, `/health`, and `/api/events` stay behind the password. There is no lockout and no rate limit in this Caddy build, so the password needs to be long (12 to 72 characters, and longer is better). The LAN address `http://<pi-ip>:8080` never asks for it. That is deliberate. Do not publish that port.

Kroger client secrets and refresh tokens are stored in `pantry.db` as plain text. The HTTP API does not return them. A copy of the database (a backup, or the Docker volume) does. Treat `pantry.db` like a password file. The app has no login of its own: if Caddy is stopped or mis-mounted and something else forwards port 8080, every route is open, including wiping inventory (the body must contain `WIPE INVENTORY`) and saving a Kroger client secret.

Automatic updates run as root and pull `latest` when you enable the timer. A bad image then starts on the same Pi that is reachable from the internet. Leave the timer off unless you want that.

Prefer a tunnel or Tailscale when you do not need a public listener. If you keep the port forward: only TCP 80 and 443, DHCP reservation, UPnP off, no forward of 8080. `sudo ./setup.sh` already limits the Pantry port to LAN sources, so a mistaken forward of that port still has to come from the LAN unless `PANTRY_LAN_FIREWALL=off`.

### Keeping HTTPS across automatic updates

`pantry-update.sh` includes the `public` profile only when `PUBLIC_HOST` is set and `auth.caddy` exists, so a timer pull renews the proxy instead of forgetting it. When `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` is set, the timer uses the `tunnel` profile instead and does not publish ports 80 or 443. `sudo ./setup.sh` copies the updated unit into `/etc/systemd/system/` if that unit is already installed. If you enabled the timer before this change and have not run setup yet:

```bash
sudo cp /opt/pantry/systemd/pantry-update.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Manual Update Procedure

To update to the latest version:

```bash
cd /opt/pantry
sudo docker compose pull
sudo docker compose up -d
```

Docker Compose will automatically:
- Download the new image if available
- Recreate the container only if the image changed
- Preserve your data volume across updates
- Apply your `.env` configuration to the new container

Recreating the container briefly drops the scanner session, but the listener reconnects on its own within 30 seconds — no manual step is needed.

## Configuration

All configuration is handled through environment variables in `/opt/pantry/.env`. Copy from `.env.example` and modify as needed:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PANTRY_IMAGE_TAG` | `latest` | Container image tag to deploy. Use `latest` for newest build, `master` for master branch, or full commit SHA to pin version |
| `HOST_PORT` | `8080` | IPv4 port for the LAN site. The container still listens on 8080. Published on `0.0.0.0` only, not IPv6. Do not forward this port on the router |
| `PUBLIC_HOST` | empty | Hostname for the public HTTPS proxy, such as `pantry.rhionin.com`. Empty keeps the install LAN-only. No `https://` |
| `PUBLISH_MODE` | empty | `tunnel` selects Cloudflare Tunnel and requires `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN`. Empty or `acme` is the certificate path, unless that token is set — a non-empty token selects tunnel on its own |
| `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` | empty | Remotely managed tunnel token from Zero Trust. Empty keeps ports 80 and 443 and Let's Encrypt. Secret. The hostname's service URL is `http://caddy:80` |
| `ACME_EMAIL` | empty | Email Let's Encrypt uses for certificate expiry notices. Required when `PUBLIC_HOST` is set and the token is empty. Not used in tunnel mode. Not a Pantry login |
| `BASIC_AUTH_USER` | `pantry` | Username the browser asks for on the public site |
| `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` | empty | Shared password for the public site, 12 to 72 characters. Required the first time the public proxy starts, unless `auth.caddy` already exists. The hash is written to `auth.caddy`; this value stays in `.env`. Setup does not replace an existing `auth.caddy` |
| `PANTRY_LAN_FIREWALL` | `on` | `off` leaves `HOST_PORT` reachable from any source. Any other value, including empty, installs the LAN-only rule when compose publishes that port or the public proxy is on |
| `PANTRY_LAN_IPV4` | empty | Private LAN address of the Pi, such as `192.168.1.203`. Empty detects it. Set this when detection prints a Docker bridge instead of the address phones should open |
| `PANTRY_SPLIT_DNS` | `off` | `on` answers `PUBLIC_HOST` with `PANTRY_LAN_IPV4` from dnsmasq on the Pi. Public DNS and the shared password stay as they are. Leave off unless clients use the Pi for DNS. Do not forward port 53 |
| `PRODUCT_CACHE_TTL` | `720h` | How long to cache product lookups (720h = 30 days) |
| `PRODUCT_MISS_TTL` | `168h` | How long to cache "not found" results (168h = 7 days) |
| `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_PRODUCT_LOOKUP` | `false` | Set to `true` to disable external API calls for product information. This also keeps product contribution local |
| `PANTRY_RETAILER_API_KEY` | empty | Store price API key. Leave empty until a retailer adapter and credentials exist. Noted sales in the app still apply |
| `PANTRY_RETAILER_API_URL` | empty | Reserved base URL for that store price adapter |
| `PRODUCT_OPENER_USER_ID` | empty | Optional. Account used only after someone opts in to share a product. Leave empty to keep contributions on this pantry |
| `PRODUCT_OPENER_PASSWORD` | empty | Optional password for that account. Each open database has its own users |
| `STOCK_IN_CONTROL_BARCODE` | `STOCK_IN` | Barcode to scan for switching scanner to "stock in" mode |
| `STOCK_OUT_CONTROL_BARCODE` | `STOCK_OUT` | Barcode to scan for switching scanner to "stock out" mode |
| `HEADLESS_USER_ID` | `user-1` | User ID for headless scan operations (when no user is logged in) |
| `SCANNER_DEVICE` | `/dev/input/pantry-scanner` | Path to the scanner's stable symlink created by the udev rule. Point at a concrete `/dev/input/eventN` to bypass the symlink while debugging |
| `SCANNER_GID` | `65532` | Numeric group ID the container process joins so it can read the `0640` scanner node |

**Note:** The variables `ADDR` and `DB_PATH` are pinned by the Docker Compose file and should not be overridden. To change the host port, use `HOST_PORT` instead of modifying `ADDR`.

After changing configuration:

```bash
cd /opt/pantry
sudo docker compose up -d
```

Setting `PUBLIC_HOST` does not publish the site by itself. Run `sudo ./setup.sh` so the `public` profile starts when `ACME_EMAIL` is set and `auth.caddy` exists (or `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` is set and `auth.caddy` does not). A plain `docker compose up` leaves that profile off. With `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` set, `sudo ./setup.sh` starts the `tunnel` profile instead. `ACME_EMAIL` is not required then.

## Headless Scanner Input

Pantry reads barcode scans directly from the scanner's evdev device (`/dev/input/eventN`) instead of standard input, so it works headlessly without a keyboard, monitor, or attached terminal session.

**The container starts whether or not the scanner is attached, and the scanner may be connected or disconnected at any time.** There is no requirement to install the udev rule or attach the scanner before starting the container.

### How hot-plug works

- The container bind-mounts the `/dev/input` **directory** rather than a single device node. Nodes that udev creates later — when you plug the scanner in — become visible inside the running container automatically, with no recreation.
- The application retries opening the device with exponential backoff, from 250 ms up to a 30 s cap. A scanner that appears (at boot, on plug-in, or on Bluetooth wake) is picked up **within 30 seconds** with no operator action.
- The web UI is served the entire time, independent of scanner state. Disconnecting the scanner does not stop, restart, or recreate the container.

### Prerequisites

1. **Find your scanner's device information:**

   **USB scanners:**
   ```bash
   lsusb | grep -i scanner
   ```
   Output looks like: `Bus 001 Device 005: ID XXXX:YYYY Symbol Technologies, Inc. Scanner`. The `XXXX` is the vendor ID and `YYYY` is the product ID.

   **Bluetooth scanners:**
   Bluetooth scanners appear as input devices and won't show in `lsusb`. Instead:
   ```bash
   # List all input event devices
   ls -l /dev/input/event*

   # Get details about a specific event device (replace eventX with your device)
   udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/input/eventX) | grep -E "(vendor|product|name)"

   # Or look for your scanner in the input device list
   cat /proc/bus/input/devices | grep -A5 -B5 -i scanner
   ```

2. **Install the udev rule.** The primary method is the setup script, which detects the device and writes the rule for you:
   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh rule
   ```

   **Manual fallback.** Copy the example rule and edit it:
   ```bash
   sudo cp /opt/pantry/udev/99-pantry-scanner.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
   ```

   **For USB scanners**, uncomment the USB example and set the vendor/product IDs. The rule matches on `ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}` and `ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}` (set directly on the event device by udev's `input_id` builtin) rather than `ATTRS{idVendor}`/`ATTRS{idProduct}`, which must walk the parent chain and are order-sensitive:
   ```
   SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event*", ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}=="XXXX", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}=="YYYY", \
     SYMLINK+="input/pantry-scanner", GROUP="65532", MODE="0640"
   ```

   **For Bluetooth scanners**, match by device name instead:
   ```
   SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event*", ATTRS{name}=="*Scanner*", \
     SYMLINK+="input/pantry-scanner", GROUP="65532", MODE="0640"
   ```
   Replace `*Scanner*` with the actual name pattern from your device (found in step 1).

   Note the symlink is `input/pantry-scanner`, which resolves to `/dev/input/pantry-scanner`. It **must** live under `/dev/input` because the container bind-mounts only that directory; a symlink elsewhere would neither exist nor resolve inside the container.

3. **Reload udev and trigger:**
   ```bash
   sudo udevadm control --reload
   sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input --action=add
   ```

4. **Verify `/dev/input/pantry-scanner` exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/input/pantry-scanner
   ```
   The symlink should exist with GID 65532 on its target node.

5. **Ensure `SCANNER_DEVICE` is set** (defaults to `/dev/input/pantry-scanner`) in `.env`.

6. **Verify scanner status:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```
   Look for the `scanner` object in the response:
   - `connected: true` and `grabbed: true` means the scanner is working
   - `connected: false` is a fully supported state — the container still runs and the UI still works; the scanner is simply absent or not yet readable

### Security: per-device scoping

Per-device scoping now comes from the scanner node's **ownership and mode**, not from the container seeing only one node. The container bind-mounts all of `/dev/input`, but the udev rule grants only the scanner's node `GROUP="65532"` mode `0640`. Every other input node stays `root:input` mode `0600`, so the container process (uid 65532, group 65532) can open the scanner and nothing else. This is why Pantry does not become a keylogger for every attached keyboard, and it is why the service user is deliberately **not** added to the `input` group — doing so would grant read access to every input device on the box.

### Local Development

For local development without a scanner, use stdin mode:
```bash
SCAN_INPUT=stdin go run ./cmd/server
```

Type barcodes directly into the terminal and press Enter. The scanner status will show `connected: false` since there's no device, but scans will still work.

### Troubleshooting

First, distinguish the two very different situations that both show `connected: false`:

- **Scanner absent** — no scanner is plugged in. This is a fully **supported** state: the container is running, `/health` returns `status: ok`, and the web UI works. Nothing is wrong. Plug the scanner in and it is picked up within 30 seconds.
- **Scanner present but unreadable** — the scanner is attached but Pantry cannot read it. This is the case worth investigating. The `lastError` field tells you which of three causes applies, in the order worth checking:

| `lastError` | Meaning | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ENOENT` / no such file | The udev rule did not match, so no symlink was created | Fix the rule's match keys (`ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}`/`ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}` for USB, `ATTRS{name}` for Bluetooth) and re-run `sudo ./setup.sh rule` |
| `EACCES` / permission denied | The node's group is not 65532 | Fix `GROUP` in the rule or `SCANNER_GID` in `.env`, then reload udev |
| `EPERM` / operation not permitted | The device cgroup denied the open | `device_cgroup_rules` is not taking effect — do **not** fall back to `privileged: true` or reintroduce a `devices:` entry; see `ACCEPTANCE.md` |

The `GET /health` `scanner` object also reports:

| Field | Expected Value | Issue if different |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| `grabbed` | `true` | Another process is using the device (the exclusive grab failed — capture still works) |
| `unmappedKeys` | Low / zero | Scanner is emitting keycodes outside the US-layout map; consider modifying `internal/scanlistener/keymap.go` |

The image is **distroless**, so `docker exec pantry sh` does not work. Use `sudo ./setup.sh logs`, `sudo docker compose logs pantry`, `GET /health`, and `sudo ./setup.sh status` for all runtime introspection.

### Automatic Updates and the scanner

`pantry-update.service` only updates the container image, never the deployment files. When `PUBLIC_HOST` is set, the update script also refreshes the public HTTPS proxy; see [Keeping HTTPS across automatic updates](#keeping-https-across-automatic-updates). This means:
- The udev rule is installed once (via `sudo ./setup.sh rule`) and is not touched by updates
- Docker Compose and `.env` files are never automatically modified

When an update recreates the container, the scanner session is dropped, but the listener reconnects on its own within 30 seconds. While iterating, run `sudo ./setup.sh freeze` to mask the update timer so an update doesn't change the target mid-experiment; run `sudo ./setup.sh thaw` to restore it.

## Data Management

### Database Location

Pantry stores its SQLite database in a Docker named volume called `pantry-data`. To inspect the volume:

```bash
sudo docker volume inspect pantry-data
```

### Backup and Restore

**Backup the database:**

```bash
# Create backup
sudo docker cp pantry:/data/pantry.db /home/pi/pantry-backup.db

# Or backup while container is stopped
sudo docker compose down
sudo docker cp pantry:/data/pantry.db /home/pi/pantry-backup.db
sudo docker compose up -d
```

**Restore from backup:**

```bash
# Stop the container
sudo docker compose down

# Restore database
sudo docker cp /home/pi/pantry-backup.db pantry:/data/pantry.db

# Restart
sudo docker compose up -d
```

### Host Directory Access (Alternative)

If you prefer a host directory instead of a named volume, modify `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /opt/pantry/data:/data
```

Then ensure proper permissions:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/pantry/data
sudo chown 65532:65532 /opt/pantry/data
```

## Version Management

### Pinning to Specific Versions

To pin to a specific version, set `PANTRY_IMAGE_TAG` in `.env` to a full commit SHA:

```bash
# Example: pin to specific commit
PANTRY_IMAGE_TAG=a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcd
```

Available tags:
- `latest` - Most recent build from master branch
- `master` - Alias for latest master branch build
- `<commit-sha>` - Specific commit (full SHA)

A pinned tag is preserved across re-runs of `sudo ./setup.sh` and is never silently reset to `latest`.

### Rolling Back

If you need to rollback to a previous version:

1. Find the commit SHA of the working version from the [repository](https://github.com/Rhionin/pantry)
2. Update `.env`:
   ```bash
   PANTRY_IMAGE_TAG=<previous-commit-sha>
   ```
3. Apply the rollback:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/pantry
   sudo docker compose up -d
   ```

## Automatic Updates (Optional)

For automatic updates, you can install systemd units that periodically check for and apply new releases. `sudo ./setup.sh` does **not** enable them by default, and a later run does not disable a timer you already turned on. Pass `--with-updates` or enable them manually when you are done iterating.

### ⚠️ Important Considerations

**Before enabling automatic updates, understand:**
- The service runs as root because it drives the Docker daemon
- Enabling automatic updates means **every push to master deploys unattended** with no approval step
- Container recreation drops the attached scanner session, but the listener reconnects on its own within 30 seconds
- If you pin to a specific commit SHA, leave automatic updates disabled (they would run forever finding nothing)

### Installation

1. Confirm Docker path:
   ```bash
   command -v docker
   # Should output: /usr/bin/docker
   ```

2. Install the systemd units. The service runs `/opt/pantry/systemd/pantry-update.sh`, which `sudo ./setup.sh` copies into place and marks executable. When `PUBLIC_HOST` is set and `auth.caddy` exists, that script keeps the HTTPS proxy in the update. Or pass `--with-updates` to `sudo ./setup.sh`.
   ```bash
   sudo cp /opt/pantry/systemd/pantry-update.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo cp /opt/pantry/systemd/pantry-update.timer /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

3. Enable and start automatic updates:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now pantry-update.timer
   ```

### Management

**Freeze / thaw during iteration:**
```bash
sudo ./setup.sh freeze   # mask the timer so updates don't change the target
sudo ./setup.sh thaw     # unmask it when you're done
```

**Check status:**
```bash
# View next scheduled update
sudo systemctl list-timers pantry-update.timer

# Check recent update attempts
sudo journalctl -u pantry-update

# View timer status
sudo systemctl status pantry-update.timer
```

**Disable automatic updates:**
```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now pantry-update.timer
```

**Manual trigger:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start pantry-update.service
```

### Update Interval

The default interval is 5 minutes after boot, then every 5 minutes. To customize:

```bash
sudo systemctl edit pantry-update.timer
```

Add:
```ini
[Timer]
OnUnitActiveSec=
OnUnitActiveSec=30min
```

Save and reload:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

**Note:** Shorter intervals mean more registry requests but no faster delivery than the build workflow's runtime.

### Rollback After Automatic Update

If an automatic update causes issues:

1. Disable automatic updates:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable --now pantry-update.timer
   ```

2. Pin to last known good version in `.env`:
   ```bash
   PANTRY_IMAGE_TAG=<last-good-commit-sha>
   ```

3. Apply rollback:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/pantry
   sudo docker compose up -d
   ```

4. Verify health:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

## Authentication (Private Repository)

Currently, `ghcr.io/rhionin/pantry` is public and requires no authentication.

If the repository becomes private, you'll need to authenticate:

```bash
# Create a GitHub personal access token with 'read:packages' permission
# Then login on the Pi:
sudo docker login ghcr.io
# Username: your-github-username
# Password: your-personal-access-token
```

The credentials are stored in root's Docker config, which is the identity the update service runs as.

## Troubleshooting

### Public website doesn't load

See [Public Internet access](#public-internet-access). On the certificate path, the usual causes are the Squarespace A record not pointing at this Pi yet, or router ports 80 and 443 not forwarded. A hang that happens only on home Wi-Fi, while cellular loads the site, is [NAT hairpin](#home-wi-fi-hangs-on-the-public-name), not a down server. In tunnel mode, both networks use Cloudflare; logs for that path are `sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.tunnel.yml --profile tunnel logs --tail=80 cloudflared`. From `/opt/pantry`:

```bash
sudo docker compose --profile public logs --tail=80 caddy
```

### Container Won't Start

Start with the full-chain diagnostic:
```bash
sudo ./setup.sh status
```

Check logs:
```bash
sudo docker compose logs pantry
```

Common issues:
- Database permissions: Ensure the `/data` volume is writable by uid 65532
- Port conflict: Another service using port 8080 (change `HOST_PORT` in `.env`)
- Image pull failure: Check network connectivity and authentication

Note the image is distroless, so `docker exec pantry sh` does not work — use logs and `/health` instead.

### Scanner Not Working

1. **Run the diagnostic first — it names the broken link:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./setup.sh status
   ```

2. **Upgrading from a pre-hot-plug version? Check `SCANNER_DEVICE`.**
   ```bash
   grep '^SCANNER_DEVICE=' /opt/pantry/.env
   ```
   An older `.env` pinned `SCANNER_DEVICE=/dev/pantry-scanner`, and the container can no longer open that path — the symlink now lives at `/dev/input/pantry-scanner`. Running `sudo ./setup.sh` migrates this obsolete default automatically; after it runs, the value should be `/dev/input/pantry-scanner`. (A custom path you set on purpose is left untouched.) Symptom of the stale value: logs show `failed to open device /dev/pantry-scanner: no such file or directory` and `status` reports the old path.

3. **Check scanner status via `/health`:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   ```
   Then use the `lastError` table in [Headless Scanner Input → Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) to tell `ENOENT` (rule didn't match), `EACCES` (wrong group), and `EPERM` (cgroup denied) apart — they have different fixes. Remember that `connected: false` with **no** error and no scanner attached is normal and supported.

4. **Verify `/dev/input/pantry-scanner` exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -l /dev/input/pantry-scanner
   ```
   If it is missing while the scanner is attached — and especially if the scanner's keystrokes are appearing in the Pi's terminal — the udev rule is not matching. The scanner echoing to the console is the tell: the rule that would grant the node to GID 65532 and create the symlink never fired. Regenerate it with `sudo ./setup.sh rule` (which now matches USB scanners on vendor/product IDs) and confirm with `ls -l /dev/input/pantry-scanner`.

5. **Check the container's mounts** (there is no longer a `Devices` array — the scanner is a directory bind mount now):
   ```bash
   sudo docker inspect -f '{{json .Mounts}}' pantry
   ```
   The `Mounts` array should include the `/dev/input` bind mount.

6. **Verify the udev rule matches your device:**
   ```bash
   lsusb                              # USB
   cat /proc/bus/input/devices        # any input device
   ```
   Ensure the `ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}`/`ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}` (USB) or `ATTRS{name}` (Bluetooth) in `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-pantry-scanner.rules` match your scanner, then re-run `sudo ./setup.sh rule`.

### Updates Failing

Check update service logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u pantry-update -f
```

Common issues:
- Network connectivity during `docker compose pull`
- Docker daemon not running
- Incorrect file paths in systemd unit

### Permission Issues

If using host bind mounts instead of named volumes:
```bash
sudo chown -R 65532:65532 /opt/pantry/data
```

### Configuration Not Applied

Ensure `.env` file is in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`:
```bash
ls -la /opt/pantry/.env
cd /opt/pantry
sudo docker compose up -d
```

## Support

For issues and support:
- Check the [Pantry repository](https://github.com/Rhionin/pantry) for documentation and issues
- Review container logs: `sudo docker compose logs pantry`
- Check system resources: `free -h && df -h`
- Verify network connectivity to GitHub Container Registry

## Development vs Production

This deployment guide covers the production container setup. For local development:

- See `frontend/README.md` for the development workflow
- Development uses separate Vite dev server + Go API server
- This deployment serves the compiled frontend embedded in the Go binary

The production container serves both the frontend and API on a single port, while development uses two separate processes on different ports.
