// Package events provides an in-memory publish/subscribe broadcaster that
// delivers Scan_Events and Inventory_Events to every browser connected to
// GET /api/events. It has no persistence: a subscriber only ever receives
// events published after it subscribes (Requirement 1.2), and there is no
// buffering or replay for a client that reconnects after a gap
// (Requirement 6.2 is satisfied by this absence, not by extra bookkeeping).
